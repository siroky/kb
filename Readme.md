  - There are four groups of features:
    - Performance: The more we invest into the feature, the more our customers are satisfied.
    - Must-be: Expected by customers, having them does not increase satisfaction, it eliminates dissatisfaction.
    - Attractive: Features that go beyond the usual expectations and having them makes customers excited.
    - Indifferent: No matter the investment, satisfaction remains the same.

## üìö Books

- [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)
  - Software delivery is an exercise in continuous improvement, the best keep getting better and those who fail to improve fall further behind.
  - Ideally we should reward developers for solving business problems with minimum amount of code, even better by not writing any code or deleting code.
  - Metrics of software delivery performance:
    - **Tempo**
      - Lead time (fast feedback loop, faster fixing of problems and improvements).
      - Deployment frequency (proxy for batch size which reduces risk and improves efficiency).
    - **Stability**
      - Mean time to restore (failure is inevitable, it's important how fast we can recover).
      - Change fail percentage (how many changes lead to outage that requires hotfix, rollback or fix-forward).
  - Software deivery performance implies:
    - Organizational performance.
    - Non-commercial performance.
    - Ability to discover faster.
  - Start with culture, which can be measured as well.
    - Pathological - fear, witholding of information.
    - Bureaucratic - following process is above fulfillment of mission.
    - Generative - focus on mission and good performance.
  - Generative culture implies good software delivery performance and organization performance
  - **Continuous delivery** has positive impact on generative culture, delivery performance, quality and even identification with the organization and work life balance.
    - Build quality in, issues should be detected as soon as possible to minimize impact and costs of fixes.
    - Work in small batches, it should be super simple to push out changes.
    - Automate manual testing and deployments, deployments should be painless for the devs.
    - Pursue continuous improvement.
    - Everyone is responsible for delivery, no segregation of development, testing and operations.
    - Everything as code stored in version control system, especially configuration of apps and system (IaC).
    - Continuous integration, short living branches integrated to main branch and immediately built and tested.
    - Continuous testing throughout development process on every commit. Test reliability and quality test data is super important.
    - Security deeply integrated into development process, security people members of teams, shifting from reviewers to tool makers.
    - Loosely coupled architecture, independence on other teams in terms of development, testability and deployability.
    - Freedom to choose tools.
  - Lean engineering management improves software delivery performance.
    - Limiting work in progress should cause process improvements.
    - Visualize important metrics.
    - Gather feedback (APM) from production and decide based on it.
    - Lightweight (e.g. intrateam) code review process is needed for good tempo.
    - Unplanned work is a good proxy measure of quality.
  - Lean product management drives and also is driven by software delivery performance.
    - Slice product to small batches, deliverable in less than a week.
    - Provide everyone great visibility into work up to understanding of customers.
    - Gather and implement user feedback.
    - Make it possible to make changes throughout the process, avoid rigid specs.
  - Transformational leadership
    - Clear understanding of vision and direction.
    - Inspirational communication,
    - Intellectual stimulation, challenge to think in new ways.
    - Supportive leadership.
    - Personal recognition.
- [Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility](https://pattymccord.com/book/)
  - Problem finders, they're cheap. While it's good to be able to identify problem, it's much more valuable to be able to solve it as well.
  - Feedback should always be given face-to-face. Instead of listening to someone complaining about someone else, ask them "Have you told them yet?".
  - Raising concerns in advance is a must. The approach of "I told you so" ex-post, while it feels good, is rather sign of bad argumentation skills.
  - Companies don't exist to make employees happy. It's great when they're happy because of doing great work with great colleagues, not because of perks.
  - Nostalgia is driver of resistance, things are changing rapidly, it's ok to move on. Managers are not career coaches. \[Pages 108-114\].
  - Scientific method FTW. Instead of data-driven decision making, it should be data-infromed, fact-based decision making.
  - Hiring should never be a numbers game. There should always be clear goal of it.
  - Everyone should be incentivized to provide non-anonymous feedback to everyone else. E.g. via KISS once a year.
